Feature: Scenario Tags
    In order to include the tags for each scenario
    As a reader of the generated documentation
    I want the scenario tags included in single line above the scenario heading.

Scenario: Output has tags for scenario
    Given I have a feature called 'My Tagged Feature'
    And I have a scenario called 'Scenario With Tags'
    And I have the scenario tags
        | Tag    |
        | ignore |
        | tagtwo |

    When I generate Markdown output
    Then the Markdown output has the lines
        | Content                 |
        | *`@ignore`* *`@tagtwo`* |
