Feature: Scenario Steps
    In order to document the Gherkin steps
    As a reader of the generated documentation
    I want the scenario steps to appear in order below the scenario heading.

Scenario: Output has simple given step for scenario
    Given I have a feature called 'My Scenario Steps Feature'
    And I have a scenario called 'Simple Given Step'
    And I have the scenario steps
        | Keyword | step                       |
        | Given   | I have a simple given step |

    When I generate Markdown output
    
    Then the Markdown output has the lines in the following order
        | Content                                |
        | #### Scenario: Simple Given Step       |
        | >                                      |
        | > **Given** I have a simple given step |


Scenario: Output has simple given & and step for scenario
    Given I have a feature called 'My Scenario Steps Feature'
    And I have a scenario called 'Multiple Given Steps'
    And I have the scenario steps
        | Keyword | step                       |
        | Given   | I have a simple given step |
        | And     | I have second given        |

        | Content                                |

        | >                                      |
        | > **Given** I have a simple given step |

    And I have the scenario step with table 'Given I have a table'
